# ECE_411_Practicum
Project development


Check out these sites for getting an idea of what we might try

https://www.adafruit.com/product/3538
this is the IR Camera

http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Data-Glasses-for-My-Multimeter/
This is an instructable for a DIY Heads up display that actually has decent documentation

https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/eagle#
You'll need to go here to download the educational version of Eagle Cad

Also because I got super excited and already ordered most of the material for the thermal overlay augmented reality HUD, if you're into that idea (because I'm eventually doing it either way) then read up on Bicubic interpolation!!!

Other programs you might want to consider
Jupyter Notebook- Allows you to use basic Latex markdown and run python in an online application.
